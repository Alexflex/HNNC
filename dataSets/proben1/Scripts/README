        README file of directory proben1/Scripts:
      ============================================

This directory contains various little Perl scripts that may be useful
when preparing data files.

These scripts are not needed to *use* PROBEN1.

You can however use them if you want to prepare additional data files
or if you want to change the representation used in one of the PROBEN1
problems.
Note that this directory must be in your PATH for the Makefiles that
use these scripts to work.
