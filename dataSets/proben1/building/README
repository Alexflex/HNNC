============================================

This dataset is problem A of the "Great energy predictor shootout" contest.
("The Great Energy Predictor Shootout" - The First Building Data Analysis And
Prediction Competition; ASHRAE Meeting; Denver, Colorado; June, 1993;
co-chaired by Jan F. Kreider and Jeff S. Haberl;
active Period:  December 1, 1992 -  April 30, 1993)

building.raw
  Concatenation of ~/shootout/atrain.dat and a_ans.dat with first line removed.
  This is the removed line:
  MONTH  DAY  YEAR  HOUR  TEMP  HUMID  SOLAR  WIND  WBE  WBCW  WBHW

building.num
  building.raw except for the month day year fields replaced by a running 
  number
  
building.cod
  building.num encoded in the way described in 'Design'

header
  Header lines used in the .dt files

building1.dt
  building.cod with header lines added
  
building2.dt
building3.dt
  two different permutations of the lines of building.cod plus the header lines

raw2num
num2cod
  Perl scripts for format conversions:
  - raw2num converts day/month/year into running record number
  - num2cod embeds the design decisions about the input and output encoding

 

Encoding:
==========

Date:  Encode weekday as nominal value.
       Encoding day of year as one continuous value means that we extrapolate!
       This is dangerous. Since the same kind of information that the day of
       year can give us (namely change of season) is already encoded in the 
       weather data, we leave the day of year out of the input encoding
       altogether.

Hour:  Don't encode hours nominally, although they will be a major information
       source, because this would have the disadvantage to split the data set
       into many quite small pieces (3000 / (24 * 7) = 18).
       The alternative is to encode hours by "distance from midnight", e.g.
       700 would be 0.7 and 2000 would be 0.4
       Since this destroys the AM/PM information, we supply a monotone
       0...1 value for the time plus an AM bit of -1/+1 additionally.
       
Weather:
       Encode temp, humid, solar, wind as 0..1 quantities
       Encode wbcw, wbhw, wbe as 0...1 quantities.
