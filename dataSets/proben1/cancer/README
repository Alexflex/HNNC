 Encoding:
===========

There are 9 input attributes, all discrete on a scale 1 - 10 (integer)
and 1 binary output attribute (2=benign, 4=malignant).
This encoding is used directly, except that the values are scaled
to a 0...1 range and that the output is represented with two units.
There are 16 missing values for attribute 6; they are encoded as 0.3 since
the average value of that attribute is rougly 3.5.

Class distribution:
