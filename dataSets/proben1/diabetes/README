===========

Although there are no missing values in this dataset according to its
documentation, there are several senseless 0 values. These most probably
indicate missing data. Nevertheless, we handle this data as if it was real,
thereby introducing some errors (or noise, if you want) into the dataset.

Attribute information: (no missing values)
0. Number of times pregnant
 1  continuous  0...17 --> 0...1  (34 records have x > 10)
1. Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
 1  continuous  0...199 --> 0...1 (5 records with value 0 are probably
    erroneous or indicate missing data; we just don't care)
2. Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
 1  continuous  0...122 --> 0...1  (35 records with value 0, next higher is 24)
3. Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
 1  continuous  0...99 --> 0...1  (227 records with value 0, next higher is 7)
4. 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
 1  continuous  0...846 --> 0...1  (347 records with value 0, next higher is 14)
5. Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
 1  continuous  0...67.1 --> 0...1 (11 records with value 0, next higher is 18)
6. Diabetes pedigree function
 1  continuous  0.078...2.42 --> 0...1
7. Age (years)
 1  continuous  21...81 --> 0...1
------
 8 inputs

8. Class variable (0 or 1)

Class distribution:
   0     65%    500  no diabetes
