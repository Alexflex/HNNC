 Files in the 'proben1/flare' directory:
=========================================

This dataset is from the UCI machine learning database:
"solar flare"

[Remark: some of the generated files may not exist in order to save disk space]

flare.names
  Original documentation for the dataset

flare.data2
  Original data file

flare.raw
  flare.data2 with first line removed.

flare.cod
  flare.raw encoded (using raw2cod)

header
  Header lines used in .dt files

flare?.dt
  different permutations of the lines of cod file plus the header lines

raw2cod
  Perl script for format conversions:
  takes flare.raw as input and produces flare.cod as output according
  to the rules given in section 'encoding' below.

Makefile
  Makefile to call scripts and programs to create .dt files

 
 Encoding:
===========

Attribute Information (no missing values):
0. Code for class (modified Zurich class)  (A,B,C,D,E,F,H)
 7  1-of-7
1. Code for largest spot size              (X,R,S,A,H,K)
 6  1-of-6  (probably some continuous encoding is possible, but which?)
2. Code for spot distribution              (X,O,I,C)
 4  1-of-4
3. Activity                                (1 = reduced, 2 = unchanged)
 1  binary
4. Evolution                     (1 = decay, 2 = no growth, 3 = growth)
 1  continuous  1->0, 2->0.5, 3->1
5. Previous 24 hour flare activity code    (1 = nothing as big as an M1,
                              2 = one M1, 3 = more activity than one M1)
 1 continuous   1->0, 2->0.5, 3->1
6. Historically-complex                    (1 = Yes, 2 = No)
 1  binary
7. Did region become historically complex  (1 = yes, 2 = no) 
    on this pass across the sun's disk
 1  binary
8. Area                                    (1 = small, 2 = large)
 1  binary
9. Area of the largest spot                (1 = <=5, 2 = >5)
 1  binary

24 inputs

(Using this encoding, inputs 0 and 23 are constant 0)
From all these attributes, three classes of flares are predicted, which are 
represented in the last three columns.

10. C-class flares production by this region    Number  
      in the following 24 hours (common flares)
 1  continuous  0...8 -> 0...1
11. M-class flares production by this region    Number
      in the following 24 hours (moderate flares)
 1  continuous  0...8 -> 0...1
12. X-class flares production by this region    Number
      in the following 24 hours (severe flares)
 1  continuous  0...2 -> 0...1
