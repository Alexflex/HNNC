 Files in the 'proben1/horse' directory:
=========================================

This dataset is from the UCI machine learning database:
"horse"

[Remark: some of the generated files may not exist in order to save disk space]

horse-colic.names
  Original documentation for the dataset

horse-colic.data
horse-colic.test
  Original data files

horse.raw
  Concatenation of horse-colic.data and horse-colic.test with a few lines
  removed: Records 79 and 86 were removed because they had an undocumented
  value '3' in the capillary refill time field; records 133 and 309 were
  removed because they had a missing value in the attribute to be predicted.

horse.cod
  horse.raw encoded (using raw2cod)

header
  Header lines used in .dt files

horse?.dt
  different permutations of the lines of cod file plus the header lines

raw2cod
  Perl script for format conversions:
  takes horse.raw as input and produces horse.cod as output according
  to the rules given in section 'encoding' below.

Makefile
  Makefile to call scripts and programs to create .dt files


 
 Encoding:
===========

This problem has VERY many missing values (about 30% overall!).
There are 364 records.
For all attributes, misses are coded explicitly by a separate 'value is 
missing' input.
There are several possible tasks that can be chosen for this dataset.
We decide to choose prediction of attribute 22 ('what happened to the horse?')
from attributes 2 and 4--21.
(Remark: the missing value counts value are based on the original
         368 records)
