 Files in the 'proben1/soybean' directory:
============================================

This dataset is from the UCI machine learning database:
"soybean"

[Remark: some of the generated files may not exist in order to save disk space]

soybean-large.names
  Original documentation for the dataset

soybean-large.data
soybean-large.test
  Original data files

soybean.raw
  Concatenation of soybean-large.data and soybean-large.test

soybean.cod
  soybean.raw encoded (using raw2cod)

header
  Header lines used in .dt files

soybean?.dt
  different permutations of the lines of cod file plus the header lines

raw2cod
  Perl script for format conversions:
  takes soybean.raw as input and produces soybean.cod as output according
  to the rules given in section 'encoding' below.

Makefile
  Makefile to call scripts and programs to create .dt files


 
 Encoding:
===========

In the original representation, all attributes are 'nominalized'.
For a neural network, however, some of them can be used as ordered
attributes that can be put onto a sensible(?) scale. These are thus encoded
as one continuous input (perhaps two, if missing values occur for this
attribute). Some of the attributes with missing values just use a default
for the missing values instead of representing 'is missing' explicitly.
Some of the attributes that have three or four values (including '?' perhaps)
are encoded binary with two inputs.
[Brute force 1-of-n encoding would result in having 135 inputs]

The output class is encoded as 1-of-19.

In contrast to some published papers about this data, we try to use
all 19 classes, even though there is only little data for some of them (not
only a small number of records, but also VERY many missing values).

Class distribution:
   8 herbicide-injury
